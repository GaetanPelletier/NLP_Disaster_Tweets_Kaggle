# Competition Description

- Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time.
Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

- In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.
You’ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified.

# About my algorithm

- I used the BERT model in order to create my own NLP algorithm.

- I used Optuna to optimize the model.

- The metric used is "F1-score".

- The algortihm developed in this Notebook achieved a F1-score of about 82% on the test set (The score is calculated by the Kaggle platform).
